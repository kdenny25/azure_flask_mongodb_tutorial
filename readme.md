# Creating a Python Flask Web App with MongoDB

Python Flask is a widely used web framework that enables developers
to create web applications quickly and efficiently. Flask 
is a lightweight and flexible framework offering developers a fullstack
solution. 

MongoDB is a popular NoSQL document-oriented database used for efficient
and fast data management. It is prized for being easily scalable and
flexible and is ideal for applications dealing with large and complex 
data sets.

This tutorial will guide you through the process of creating a blog
using Python Flask web app that uses MongoDB as a database. All the 
work in this portion of the tutorial is used for development and will 
be managed locally. The next portion of the tutorial will walk you 
through deploying a production ready app to Microsoft Azure directly 
from your Github repository. Let's begin.

## Prerequisites

* This tutorial assumes you are familiar with Python and
know how to build a Pytho project from either the command line or
an IDE of your choosing. 

* We also assume you have an understanding of Flask and Jinja templates

* Download and install MongoDB to your computer. Follow this link

# Deploying a Python Flask Web App from GitHub to Azure

GitHub is a web-based platform for version control that enables 
developers to store, manage, and share their code. It provides a range
of features, including project management and code review tools, 
and allows for collaboration with others.

Microsoft Azure is a cloud computer platform that offers a wide range of
services for building, deploying, and managing applications in a
scalable and secure environment. It provides support for popular
programming languages, making it easy for developers to create
and deploy web applications.
